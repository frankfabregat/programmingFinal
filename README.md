# Programming Final C
### By Francisco Fabregat, Ryan Trudell, and Nicholas Tey.

This simple Tic Tac Toe game made in C is made to play with 2 people. It recognizes when someone wins the game, or it is a tie, asks the user if they want to play again, and repeats the game. It also keeps track of win scores and displays the final score when the user decides not to play anymore.
